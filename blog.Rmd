We want to see what trends or patterns have emerged since the Citizens United case was decided in 2010. In particular, what has happened to political contributions from for-profit corporations since the decision. If there has been a notable increase, has a particular party benefitted disproportionally, how has the money been channeled to campaigns â€“ individual candidates, PACs, etc since 2010?
